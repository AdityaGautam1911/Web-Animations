# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### 1. `npm start`
- Launches the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- The page will reload when you make changes.
- Lint errors (if any) will be displayed in the console.

### 2. `npm test`
- Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- For more details, refer to [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### 3. `npm run build`
- Builds the app for production, outputting the result to the `build` folder.
- The production build optimizes React for best performance, minifying code and generating files with hashes for caching.
- For more details, see [Deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### 4. `npm run eject`
**Caution: This is a one-way operation! Once ejected, it can't be reversed.**

- Ejecting copies all configuration files (like webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project, allowing you full control over the setup.
- All commands will continue to work, but now they point to your own configurations instead of the default ones.
- It's optional and only needed for advanced customizations.
